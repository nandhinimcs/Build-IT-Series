# Build<IT> – Hands-On Coding Sprint

## 🚀 About Build<IT>
Build<IT> is a **pure hands-on coding sprint** designed to **bridge the gap between developers and actual development**. Unlike traditional tech events, we focus on **building** instead of just listening. No long theoretical talks—just **coding, debugging, and deploying real projects**.

With the power of **GitHub Copilot**, participants will build their **own developer portfolio website** from scratch in just **4 hours**.

## 🎯 Who Can Participate?
- College students, freshers, and early-career developers
- Anyone who wants to **level up their development skills**
- Those who have **never built their own portfolio website**
- Developers who want to learn **GitHub Copilot for hands-on coding**
